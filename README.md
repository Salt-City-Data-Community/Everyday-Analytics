# Everyday Analytics

Supplement to talk and workshop for Syracuse Open Data Day 2023

## Health and Weather Data
### health-data
The health-data-analysis Python Jupyter Notebook provides an example for working with exported XML-format health data from an Apple iPhone and local weather data from NOAA in CSV-format. It focuses on collected steps data and daily temperature data for January - September 2023.

If running locally, file names will need to be altered accordingly for the imports at the start of the code. Desired NOAA weather data can be exported from their [Climate Data Online Search](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search).

## Email Data
### email-data
This Python code offers an example for performing some basic text analysis on subject line words in a Gmail inbox. Google email data can be exported through these instructions: [How to Download Your Google Data](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190). The example is for a small sample of 50 emails from October 2023.

Mail data often exports as an MBOX file type that can be previewed in text editors for its data structure. If running locally, change the filename for the mbox accordingly.
